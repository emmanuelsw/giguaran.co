## About this blog

This is not your tipical tech blog, it is more like a place to post what I've been working or learning recently or take notes that I would like to remember or revisit later.

If you have any comments or questions about any of the posts I write
here feel free to [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/guilleiguaran).

This blog is done with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and uses <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko theme</a> designed and developed by [@gfjaru](https://twitter.com/gfjaru).

## About me
